{\large \bf ABSTRACT}
\end{center}
Our main objective of this project is to reduce the cost of industrial process using IoT based applications, so in the application we have used Wireless sensor networks as part of major computing technique, which is widely used for monitoring and analyze real-time large-scale data. the sensor is made to operate under highly extreme conditions designed with an application in mind .to make this kind of wireless sensor application is challenging process which involves many parameters which are required by target application which includes range of sensors, types of sensor, technology type, mode of communication, software compatibility, life time of sensors, security issues, programming languages.in this project we tried to minimize the total cost of the IOT application.  \\

{\it Keywords:} IoT, computing, monitoring, WSN, compatibility, security.
